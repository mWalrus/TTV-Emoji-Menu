# TTV Emoji Menu

This is a simple browser extension for Twitch that adds an emoji menu
to channel chat. A new button is created under the chat input box
which when clicked loads a popup containing the application.

Combos can be created and edited in this section. When the user click
the "Edit Combos" button the interface is pretty straight forward for
the user to follow.
